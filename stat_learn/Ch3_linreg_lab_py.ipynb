        "- Mean squared error (MSE) (`tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError`) and mean absolute error (MAE) (`tf.keras.losses.MeanAbsoluteError`) are common loss functions used for regression problems. MAE is less sensitive to outliers. Different loss functions are used for classification problems.\n",
        "- Similarly, evaluation metrics used for regression differ from classification.\n",
        "- When numeric input data features have values with different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently to the same range.\n",
        "- Data quality is very important in training the model, model mismatches are a big problem for any ML models.\n",
        "- Overfitting is a common problem for DNN models, though it wasn't a problem for this tutorial. Visit the Google ML crash course [Overfit and underfit](overfit_and_underfit.ipynb) tutorial for more help with this."
